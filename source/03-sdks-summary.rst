SDKs Summary
=================

There are two main SDKs that allow you to integrate your app with KWS.

1. **Frontend SDK**: This SDK will help you interact with KWS from your frontend, allowing you to complete tasks like the following:
    * Forwarding unauthenticated users to the single sign-on page (the Club).

    * Making requests to KWS (like viewing a user's profile and points, triggering events that award points to users, getting leaderboards, etc).

    * Showing notifications to the user.

2. **Node.js SDK**: This SDK will help you easily integrate your Node.js application with KWS. It will handle user authentication integration with KWS and provide some additional functions to interact with KWS - allowing you to get data like your app statistics.
