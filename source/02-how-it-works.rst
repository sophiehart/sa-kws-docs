How it works
=============

Kids Web Services is a set of of compliance-as-a-service tools that allows you to easily create applications and sites aimed at kids -  without having to deal with the complexity of complying to kids data privacy laws yourself.

Using KWS, your application will not need any database for handling users data. This means that you'll be able to focus on creating awesome content! KWS tools include:

    * **Secure single sign-on page, also known as "the Club"** - designed specifically for kids safety and compliance. Your application will redirect users to the Club when they want to login to your app. Once they do, they will return to your app and will be signed into their secure account.

    * **A Parent Portal, which enables Verifiable Parental Consent (as required by COPPA and EU data privacy law)**. Verfied Parents can easily manage their kids' data and permissions from here.

        (The Parent Portal allows parents to manage their kids personal information, allowing or restricting data access on an app by app basis)
