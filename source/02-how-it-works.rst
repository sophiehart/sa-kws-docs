How it Works
=============

Kids Web Services is a set of of compliance-as-a-service tools that allows you to easily create applications targeted for Kids without the hassle of dealing with the complexity of compliance.

KWS provides you with a set of tools so that your application does not need any database for handling users data. You will be able to focus on creating awesome content instead. These tools include the following:

    * **Single sign-on page, also known as "the Club"**. Your application will redirect users to the Club when they want to login to your app. Once they do, they will get back to your app and they will be signed in.

        (The Club is a single sign-on page specially designed for Kids safety and compliance)

    * **A Parent Portal for Verifiable Parental Consent**. Parents can manage their Kids data and permissions from here.

        (The Parent Portal allows parents to manage their Kids, allowing or restricting data access for apps)
